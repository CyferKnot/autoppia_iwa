You are an expert in web automation. Analyze the given HTML element and output a JSON object with the following fields. Only include fields that are meaningful â€” otherwise use null.

Fields to include:
- one_phrase_summary
- summary
- categories
- functionality
- media_files_description
- key_words
- relevant_fields
- curiosities
- accessibility

Format the output as flat JSON. Do not include explanations or the HTML itself.

Now analyze this element:
${element}

Format your output as strict JSON. Do not include explanations.
